## Coronary artery bulk ATAC-seq analysis

Here we provide scripts for bulk ATAC-seq analysis for coronary artery samples from over a hundred patients

We used the Omni-ATAC protocol (Corces et al. 2017) to perform ATAC-seq on these frozen samples.

We then used the [PEPATAC](http://pepatac.databio.org/en/latest/) pipeline (Smith et al. bioRxiv 2020) to perform read mapping, quality control, and peak calling.
